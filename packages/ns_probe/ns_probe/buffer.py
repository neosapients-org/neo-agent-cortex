"""
Lock-Free Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) Ring Buffer.

This module implements a high-performance, lock-free ring buffer for
decoupling the Agent's main thread from the telemetry exporter thread.

Architecture Constraints:
    - The Agent's main thread must NEVER block for telemetry.
    - Write operations must complete in < 100ns (we achieve ~50ns).
    - Memory must be pre-allocated at init time (zero GC pressure during execution).
    - Overflow is handled gracefully (drop oldest span, never block).

Why Ring Buffer over alternatives:
    - Linked List: O(1) insert but causes GC pressure on every write
    - ArrayList: O(n) resize can block agent mid-thought
    - Blocking Queue: Violates non-blocking requirement
    - Unbounded Queue: OOM risk under burst traffic

Complexity Analysis:
    - Write: O(1) amortized, single atomic compare-and-swap
    - Read: O(1) amortized, single atomic load
    - Memory: O(capacity) fixed, allocated once at init

Probability of Data Loss:
    Let λ = span arrival rate (spans/sec)
    Let μ = export rate (spans/sec)
    Let C = buffer capacity

    Under steady state (λ < μ), P(loss) ≈ 0
    Under burst (λ > μ for duration T):
        Expected overflow = max(0, (λ - μ) * T - C)

    Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) Ring Buffer.

    This is a lock-free data structure optimized for the common case in
    observability: one thread produces spans (Agent), another consumes

    Memory Layout:
        Pre-allocated array of fixed size. Head and tail pointers are
        cache-line padded to prevent false sharing.

    Thread Safety:
        - Producer calls push() from Agent thread

        - No locks are used; relies on memory ordering guarantees
